Get To Work Podcast Randomizer

Podcast locations are randomized inside their original areas. They can sometimes end up inside collision or in hard to reach areas. Quiting and reloading will re-randomize the locations of any unobtained podcasts.

Requires BepInEx.

Install by placing PodcastRandomizer.dll in `Steam\steamapps\common\Get To Work\BepInEx\plugins`
